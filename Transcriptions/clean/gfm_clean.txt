I don't say some point, I do, I could lose our world
I don't ever lose, I don't know, somewhere else I don't
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, when good for me, do be a tankle when can she be?
Baby, hey, keep listenin' me with good times and tears seein'
Good vibes and your body, yeah, good try, that's not for me, yeah
Good night, I'm not sorry, yeah
I like the way you move, right like a million others do
Find out what's good for you, right now just keep me in the queue
I guess that's how you move, got me thinkin' that's probably what I should do
Ain't tryna make a choose, ain't nothin' I can do, yeah
Just happenin'
But that's when I understand what just happened
Do you see me?
I just woke up one day and I knew, see me now

If you keep me on your loan
What I was never sure I would keep
Good vibes in your body
Good try, that's not for me
Good night, I'm not sorry

Thanks for watching guys!

I had to be there now
When my blood beams in your head
When my feelings are so hollow, hollow
