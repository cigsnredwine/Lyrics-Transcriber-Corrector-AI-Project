DAY YOU KNOW I don't want to be apart, I don't want to be apart In a long time, I've been waiting for you I just want you to look at me, don't stop me I've been waiting for you You know I'm singing a angel, a man with a heart that's gentle I just want you around me, killin' my

Killin' my vibe, I'm a mental Making me high, accidental Your my ex-susces I'm under beat, yeah In my mind, I'm still the same I'm still the same I'm still the same I'm still the same It's just a fact that I want you to realize Confirmed, I will use you Always on my mind You know it hurts not having you Right by my side If this ain't love, I still don't wanna say goodbye Hold on, baby This is you and me tonight Your body on me Can you kiss me right? Kiss me right I'm not wrong I don't want to be wrong, I don't want to be wrong I'm always, always, always on my mind You know it hurts not having you Right by my side

I had to be there now When my blood beams in your head When my feelings are so hollow, hollow
